2D Platformer Tutorial

This is a 2D platformer showing very basic mechanics, that I created for the purpose of showing and teaching students how to implement these mechanics. It was also used for the following purposes:
-Showing students how to implement sprites, add animations and change animation states according to code
-Showing students how to implement and use various UI elements such as buttons and text mesh pro to create menus and landing pages
-Showing students how to import and use sound in their game
-Showing students how to display a score or ammo count using the canvas in Unity
-Instructing students on how to properly set up their UI
